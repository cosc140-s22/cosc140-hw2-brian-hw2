# COSC140 homework 2

## Homework feedback

 * How long did you spend on this homework?

I spent about an hour on the first question and then a couple more hours on the second. I think this is mainly because I wasn't too familiar with using loops within python so I had to learn how to get used to that. I also did not know what to draw for a very long time haha. 


 * What did you think about it?  What was good?  What could be improved?

I really liked this homework. I think it was a great way to learn more about python and the turtle drawings within it. I think it would be improved if you maybe showed us a demo of you creating a quick drawing in turtle beforehand so that we would have been able to visualize how to use each method within turtle. Either way though, I thought it was a great exercise.
