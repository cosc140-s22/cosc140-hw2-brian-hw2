# COSC140 homework 2

## Homework feedback

 * How long did you spend on this homework?

I spent about an hour on the first question and then a couple more hours on the second. I think this is mainly because I wasn't too familiar with using loops within python so I had to learn how to get used to that. I also did not know what to draw for a very long time haha. 


 * What did you think about it?  What was good?  What could be improved?

I really liked this homework. I think it was a great way to learn more about python and the turtle drawings within it. I think it would be improved if you maybe showed us a demo of you creating a quick drawing in turtle beforehand so that we would have been able to visualize how to use each method within turtle. Either way though, I thought it was a great exercise.

Good work.  On the bus problem, the computations aren't quite right.  I'd suggest first computing the total time in seconds and then going from there to figure out when the trip ends.  There's a floating point computation early on that is likely resulting in some errors (floating point computations are inexact), and while some examples work out correctly, most of the examples listed in the homework don't quite work correctly. 

Nice job on the face!  I liked what you did with that problem.
